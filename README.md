# Student Project Template 
## Build & Run
## Release workflow
- We keep ONE repository for the whole project.
- At the end of each checkpoint, mark a release tag and add your report.

### Mark a release tag
###  end of Release 1:
git tag release-1
git push origin release-1

###  end of Release 2:
git tag release-2
git push origin release-2

### Folders for documents
docs/release-1/  # slides, SRS/SDP updates, test report
docs/release-2/
docs/release-3/...
